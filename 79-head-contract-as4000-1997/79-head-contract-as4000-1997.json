The changes required by the Amendments \nare indicated in the text by a marginal bar and amendment number against the \nclause, note, table, figure, or part thereof affected. \nThis Standard is the result of a consensus among Australian and New Zealand \nrepresentatives on the Joint Committee to produce it as an Australian Standard. \nSubclauses 8.6 and 29.2 (prefixed by an asterisk) are optional, and may be omitted in \nthe Contract, where necessary, without making consequential amendments but such \nomission should be clearly shown on the face of the document by striking out these \nsubclauses or indicating clearly in clause 1 of Annexure Part B or elsewhere that \nthey are not to apply. See paragraph (i) of clause 1 on page 5 for the effect of stating \ndeletions in Annexure Part B. \nWarning \nUsers of this Australian Standard are warned that clause 15 (Damage to \npersons and property other than work under the Contract (âWUCâ)) does not \nlimit the liability of parties for special, indirect or consequential losses. \nThis unlimited liability applies notwithstanding any limitations or exclusions \npermitted under insurance clauses 16 (Insurance of the Works) and 17 (Public \nliability insurance). \nParties wishing to limit their liability should seek insurance and legal advice \nbefore entering a contract under this Standard. \nLegislation has come into force in some jurisdictions dealing with security of \npayments. Parties intending to use this Standard should seek expert advice as to \ntheir rights and obligations under such legislation. \n \n \nA2\nInternal Use Only\nLicensed to ROMANA VRECKO on 16 Feb 2006. 1 user personal user licence only.
