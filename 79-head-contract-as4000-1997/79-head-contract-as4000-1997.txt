Keeping Standards up-to-date 
Standards are living documents which reflect progress in science, technology and 
systems. To maintain their currency, all Standards are periodically reviewed, and 
new editions are published. Between editions, amendments may be issued. Standards 
may also be withdrawn. It is important that readers assure themselves they are using 
a current Standard, which should include any amendments which may have been 
published since the Standard was purchased. 
Detailed information about Standards can be found by visiting the Standards Web 
Shop at www.standards.com.au and looking up the relevant Standard in the on-line 
catalogue. 
Alternatively, the printed Catalogue provides information current at 1 January each 
year, and the monthly magazine, The Global Standard, has a full listing of revisions 
and amendments published each month. 
Australian StandardsTM and other products and services developed by Standards 
Australia are published and distributed under contract by SAI Global, which 
operates the Standards Web Shop. 
We also welcome suggestions for improvement in our Standards, and especially 
encourage readers to notify us immediately of any apparent inaccuracies or 
ambiguities. Contact us via email at mail@standards.org.au, or write to the Chief 
Executive, Standards Australia, GPO Box 5420, Sydney, NSW 2001.

Preface 
This Standard was prepared by the Joint Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand 
Committee OB/3, General Conditions of Contract. 
This Standard incorporates Amendment  1 (August 1999), Amendment 2 (October 
2000), and Amendment 3 (March 2005). The changes required by the Amendments 
are indicated in the text by a marginal bar and amendment number against the 
clause, note, table, figure, or part thereof affected. 
This Standard is the result of a consensus among Australian and New Zealand 
representatives on the Joint Committee to produce it as an Australian Standard. 
Subclauses 8.6 and 29.2 (prefixed by an asterisk) are optional, and may be omitted in 
the Contract, where necessary, without making consequential amendments but such 
omission should be clearly shown on the face of the document by striking out these 
subclauses or indicating clearly in clause 1 of Annexure Part B or elsewhere that 
they are not to apply. See paragraph (i) of clause 1 on page 5 for the effect of stating 
deletions in Annexure Part B. 
Warning 
Users of this Australian Standard are warned that clause 15 (Damage to 
persons and property other than work under the Contract (âWUCâ)) does not 
limit the liability of parties for special, indirect or consequential losses. 
This unlimited liability applies notwithstanding any limitations or exclusions 
permitted under insurance clauses 16 (Insurance of the Works) and 17 (Public 
liability insurance). 
Parties wishing to limit their liability should seek insurance and legal advice 
before entering a contract under this Standard. 
Legislation has come into force in some jurisdictions dealing with security of 
payments. Parties intending to use this Standard should seek expert advice as to 
their rights and obligations under such legislation.

Contract and directions authorised by the Contract. 
The Principal shall pay the Contractor: 
a) 
for work for which the Principal accepted a lump sum, the lump sum; 
and

Clause 3:  Provisional sums 
Copyright 
c) 
notwithstanding any other provision of the Contract, the Contractor 
shall not be entitled to payment until the Contractor has lodged the 
bill of quantities so priced and extended. 
If the aggregate amount in a priced bill of quantities does not equal the sum 
accepted for the work, the subject of the bill of quantities, the 
Superintendent shall (unless the parties agree within 7 days of notification) 
determine an appropriate correction of errors and inconsistencies in rates 
and prices therein, so that the aggregate amount equals such sum. 
2.4 
Quantities 
Quantities in a bill of quantities or schedule of rates are estimated 
quantities only. 
The Superintendent is not required to give a direction by reason of the 
actual quantity of an item required to perform the Contract being greater or 
less than the quantity shown in a bill of quantities which forms part of the 
Contract or schedule of rates. 
2.5 
Adjustment for actual quantities 
Where, otherwise than by reason of a direction to vary WUC, the actual 
quantity of an item required to perform the Contract is greater or less than 
the quantity shown in a bill of quantities which forms part of the Contract 
or schedule of rates: 
a) 
the Principal accepted a lump sum for the item, the difference shall 
be a deemed variation; 
b) 
the Principal accepted a rate for the item, the rate shall apply to the 
greater or lesser quantities provided that where limits of accuracy for 
a quantity in a schedule of rates are stated in Item 11, the rate shall 
apply to the greater or lesser quantities within the limits, and 
quantities outside the limits shall be a deemed variation. 
If such a bill of quantities or schedule of rates omits an item which should 
have been included, the item shall be a deemed variation. 
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subclause in respect of a 
bill of quantities, a variation shall not be deemed for actual quantities of an 
item pursuant to paragraph (a), or for an omitted item or any adjustment 
made for actual quantities of an item pursuant to paragraph (b), if the 
difference, the value of the omitted item or the adjustment respectively is 
less than $400. 
3 
Provisional sums 
A provisional sum included in the Contract shall not itself be payable by 
the Principal but where pursuant to a direction the work or item to which 
the provisional sum relates is carried out or supplied by the Contractor, the 
work or item shall be priced by the Superintendent, and the difference shall 
be added to or deducted from the contract sum.

versa; and 
b)

Provision 
Security shall be provided in accordance with Item 13 or 14. All delivered 
security, other than cash or retention moneys, shall be transferred in

substitute another form of security. To the extent that another form of 
security is provided, the other party shall not deduct, and shall promptly

5.4

(whether or not in combination with other risks), the Contractor shall to the 
extent directed by the Superintendent, rectify the loss or damage and such 
rectification shall be a deemed variation. If loss or damage is caused by a 
combination of excepted risks and other risks, the Superintendent in pricing 
the variation shall assess the proportional responsibility of the parties.

allowance by the Principal to the Contractor, if the Contractor has 
not completed such reinstatement, insurance moneys received shall, if

Clause 26:  Setting out the Works 
21 
25 
Latent conditions 
25.1 Scope 
Latent conditions are physical conditions on the site and its near surrounds, 
including artificial things but excluding weather conditions, which differ 
materially from the physical conditions which should reasonably have been 
anticipated by a competent Contractor at the time of the Contractorâs 
tender if the Contractor had inspected: 
a) 
all written information made available by the Principal to the 
Contractor for the purpose of tendering; 
b) 
all information influencing the risk allocation in the Contractorâs 
tender and reasonably obtainable by the making of reasonable 
enquiries; and 
c) 
the site and its near surrounds. 
25.2 Notification 
The Contractor, upon becoming aware of a latent condition while carrying 
out WUC, shall promptly, and where possible before the latent condition is 
disturbed, give the Superintendent written notice of the general nature 
thereof. 
If required by the Superintendent promptly after receiving that notice, the 
Contractor shall, as soon as practicable, give the Superintendent a written 
statement of: 
a) 
the latent condition encountered and the respects in which it differs 
materially; 
b) 
the additional work, resources, time and cost which the Contractor 
estimates to be necessary to deal with the latent condition; and 
c) 
other details reasonably required by the Superintendent. 
25.3 Deemed variation 
The effect of the latent condition shall be a deemed variation, priced 
having no regard to additional cost incurred more than 28 days before the 
date on which the Contractor gave the notice required by the first 
paragraph of subclause 25.2 but so as to include the Contractorâs other 
costs for each compliance with subclause 25.2. 
26 
Setting out the Works 
26.1 Setting out 
The Principal shall ensure that the Superintendent gives the Contractor the 
data, survey marks and like information necessary for the Contractor to set 
out the Works, together with those survey marks specified in the Contract. 
Thereupon the Contractor shall set out the Works in accordance with the 
Contract.

Clause 27:  Cleaning up 
Copyright 
26.2 Errors in setting out 
The Contractor shall rectify every error in the position, level, dimensions 
or alignment of any WUC after promptly notifying the Superintendent and 
unless the Superintendent within 3 days directs otherwise. 
If the error was caused by incorrect data, survey marks or information given 
by the Superintendent, the cost incurred by the Contractor in rectifying the 
error shall be assessed by the Superintendent and added to the contract 
sum. 
26.3 Care of survey marks 
The Contractor shall keep in their true positions all survey marks supplied 
by the Superintendent. 
The Contractor shall reinstate any survey mark disturbed, after promptly 
notifying the Superintendent and unless the Superintendent within 3 days 
directs otherwise. 
If the disturbance was caused by the Superintendent or a person referred to 
in subclause 24.2 other than the Contractor, the cost incurred by the 
Contractor in reinstating the survey mark shall be assessed by the 
Superintendent and added to the contract sum. 
27 
Cleaning up 
The Contractor shall keep the site and WUC clean and tidy and regularly 
remove rubbish and surplus material. 
Within 14 days after the date of practical completion, the Contractor shall 
remove temporary works and construction plant. The Superintendent may 
extend the time to enable the Contractor to perform remaining obligations. 
If the Contractor fails to comply with the preceding obligations in this 
clause, the Superintendent may direct the Contractor to rectify the 
non-compliance and the time for rectification. 
If: 
a) 
the Contractor fails to comply with such a direction; and  
b) 
that failure has not been made good within 5 days after the 
Contractor receives written notice from the Superintendent that the 
Principal intends to have the subject work carried out by others, 
the Principal may have that work so carried out and the Superintendent 
shall certify the cost incurred as moneys due from the Contractor to the 
Principal. The rights given by this paragraph are additional to any other 
rights and remedies.

the Principal may have that work so rectified and the Superintendent shall 
certify the cost incurred as moneys due from the Contractor to the 
Principal. 
29.4 Acceptance of defective work 
Instead of a direction pursuant to subclause 29.3, the Superintendent may 
direct the Contractor that the Principal elects to accept the subject work, 
whereupon there shall be a deemed variation. 
29.5 Timing 
The Superintendent may give a direction pursuant to this clause at any time 
before the expiry of the last defects liability period. 
30 
Examination and testing 
30.1 Tests

fully complies with the Contract. 
Results of tests shall be promptly made available by each party to the other

the Principal except where the Contract otherwise provides or the test is 
consequent upon, or reveals a failure of the Contractor to comply with the 
Contract (including this clause). 
31 
Working hours 
If the working hours and working days on the site are not stated elsewhere 
in the Contract, they shall be as notified by the Contractor to the 
Superintendent before commencement of work on site. They shall not be 
varied without the Superintendentâs prior written approval, except when, in 
the interests of safety of persons or property, the Contractor finds it 
necessary to carry out WUC otherwise, whereupon the Contractor shall give 
the Superintendent written notice of those circumstances as early as 
possible. 
32 
Programming

when 
the 
Contractor 
needs 
information, 
materials, 
documents or 
instructions from the Superintendent or the Principal.

information, materials, documents or instructions earlier than the Principal 
or the Superintendent, as the case may be, should reasonably have 
anticipated at the date of acceptance of tender. 
The Superintendent may direct in what order and at what time the various 
stages or portions of WUC shall be carried out. If the Contractor can 
reasonably comply with the direction, the Contractor shall do so. If the 
Contractor cannot reasonably comply, the Contractor shall give the

Clause 33:  Suspension 
Copyright 
A  construction program is a written statement showing the dates by which, 
or the times within which, the various stages or portions of WUC are to be 
carried out or completed. It shall be deemed a Contract document. 
The Superintendent may direct the Contractor to give the Superintendent a 
construction program within the time and in the form directed. 
The Contractor shall not, without reasonable cause, depart from a 
construction program. 
If compliance with any such directions under this clause, except those 
pursuant to the Contractorâs default, causes the Contractor to incur more or 
less cost than otherwise would have been incurred had the Contractor not 
been given the direction, the difference shall be assessed by the 
Superintendent and added to or deducted from the contract sum. 
33 
Suspension 
33.1 Superintendentâs suspension 
The Superintendent may direct the Contractor to suspend the carrying out 
of the whole or part of WUC for such time as the Superintendent thinks fit, 
if the Superintendent is of the opinion that it is necessary: 
a) 
because of an act, default or omission of: 
i) 
the Superintendent, the Principal or its employees, consultants, 
agents or other contractors (not being employed by the 
Contractor); or 
ii) 
the Contractor, a subcontractor or eitherâs employees or agents; 
b) 
for the protection or safety of any person or property; or 
c) 
to comply with a court order. 
33.2 Contractorâs suspension 
If the Contractor wishes to suspend the carrying out of the whole or part of 
WUC, otherwise than pursuant to subclause 39.9, the Contractor shall 
obtain the Superintendentâs prior written approval. The Superintendent may 
approve the suspension and may impose conditions of approval. 
33.3 Recommencement 
As soon as the Superintendent becomes aware that the reason for any 
suspension no longer exists, the Superintendent shall direct the Contractor 
to recommence suspended WUC as soon as reasonably practicable. 
The 
Contractor 
may 
recommence 
WUC 
suspended 
pursuant 
to 
subclause 33.2 or 39.9 at any time after reasonable notice to the 
Superintendent.

33.4 Cost 
The Contractor shall bear the cost of suspension pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(ii) of subclause 33.1 and subclause 33.2. If the Contractor made the 
protection, safety or court order necessary, the Contractor shall bear the 
cost of suspension pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of subclause 33.1. If the 
Contractor otherwise incurs more or less cost than otherwise would have 
been incurred, the difference shall be assessed by the Superintendent and 
added to or deducted from the contract sum. 
34 
Time and progress 
34.1 Progress 
The Contractor shall ensure that WUC reaches practical completion by the 
date for practical completion. 
34.2 Notice of delay 
A party becoming aware of anything which will probably cause delay to 
WUC shall promptly give the Superintendent and the other party written 
notice of that cause and the estimated delay. 
34.3 Claim 
The Contractor shall be entitled to such extension of time for carrying out 
WUC (including reaching practical completion) as the Superintendent 
assesses (âEOTâ), if: 
a) 
the Contractor is or will be delayed in reaching practical completion 
by a qualifying cause of delay; and 
b) 
the Contractor gives the Superintendent, within 28 days of when the 
Contractor should reasonably have become aware of that causation 
occurring, a written claim for an EOT evidencing the facts of 
causation and of the delay to WUC (including extent). 
If further delay results from a qualifying cause of delay evidenced in a 
claim under paragraph (b) of this subclause, the Contractor shall claim an 
EOT for such delay by promptly giving the Superintendent a written claim 
evidencing the facts of that delay. 
34.4 Assessment 
When both non-qualifying and qualifying causes of delay overlap, the 
Superintendent shall apportion the resulting delay to WUC according to the 
respective causesâ contribution. 
In assessing each EOT the Superintendent shall disregard questions of 
whether: 
a) 
WUC can nevertheless reach practical completion without an EOT; or 
b) 
the Contractor can accelerate, 
but shall have regard to what prevention and mitigation of the delay has not 
been effected by the Contractor.

34.5 Extension of time 
Within 28 days after receiving the Contractorâs claim for an EOT, the 
Superintendent shall give to the Contractor and the Principal a written 
direction evidencing the EOT so assessed. If the Superintendent does not do 
so, there shall be a deemed assessment and direction for an EOT as claimed. 
Notwithstanding that the Contractor is not entitled to or has not claimed an 
EOT, the Superintendent may at any time and from time to time before 
issuing the final certificate direct an EOT. 
34.6 Practical completion 
The Contractor shall give the Superintendent at least 14 days written notice 
of the date upon which the Contractor anticipates that practical completion 
will be reached. 
When the Contractor is of the opinion that practical completion has been 
reached, the Contractor shall in writing request the Superintendent to issue 
a certificate of practical completion. Within 14 days after receiving the 
request, the Superintendent shall give the Contractor and the Principal 
either a certificate of practical completion evidencing the date of practical 
completion or written reasons for not doing so. 
If the Superintendent is of the opinion that practical completion has been 
reached, the Superintendent may issue a certificate of practical completion 
even though no request has been made. 
34.7 Liquidated damages 
If WUC does not reach practical completion by the date for practical 
completion, the Superintendent shall certify, as due and payable to the 
Principal, liquidated damages in Item 24 for every day after the date for 
practical completion to and including the earliest of the date of practical 
completion or termination of the Contract or the Principal taking WUC out 
of the hands of the Contractor. 
If an EOT is directed after the Contractor has paid or the Principal has set 
off liquidated damages, the Principal shall forthwith repay to the 
Contractor such of those liquidated damages as represent the days the 
subject of the EOT. 
34.8 Bonus for early practical completion 
If the date of practical completion is earlier than the date for practical 
completion the Superintendent shall certify as due and payable to the 
Contractor the bonus in Item 25(a) for every day after the date of practical 
completion to and including the date for practical completion. 
The Contractor hereby waives that part of a bonus exceeding the Item 25(b) 
amount. 
34.9 Delay damages 
For every day the subject of an EOT for a compensable cause and for which 
the Contractor gives the Superintendent a claim for delay damages pursuant 
to subclause 41.1, damages certified by the Superintendent under subclause 
41.3 shall be due and payable to the Contractor.

shall include details of the value of WUC done and may include details of 
other moneys then due to the Contractor pursuant to provisions of the 
Contract. 
37.2 Certificates 
The Superintendent shall, within 14 days after receiving such a progress 
claim, issue to the Principal and the Contractor:

within 21 days after the Superintendent receives the progress claim, pay to 
the Contractor the balance of the progress certificate after deducting

the Principal elects to set off. If that setting off produces a negative 
balance, the Contractor shall pay that balance to the Principal within 7 
days of receiving written notice thereof. 
Neither a progress certificate nor a payment of moneys shall be evidence 
that the subject WUC has been carried out satisfactorily. Payment other than 
final payment shall be payment on account only.

Standards Australia 
Standards Australia is an independent company, limited by guarantee, which prepares and publishes 
most of the voluntary technical and commercial standards used in Australia. These standards are 
developed through an open process of consultation and consensus, in which all interested parties are 
invited to participate. Through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Commonwealth government, 
Standards Australia is recognized as Australiaâs peak national standards body.  For further information

Australian Standards 
Australian Standards are prepared by committees of experts from industry, governments, consumers 
and other relevant sectors. The requirements or recommendations contained in published Standards 
are a consensus of the views of representative interests and also take account of comments received 
from other sources. They reflect the latest scientific and industry experience. Australian Standards are 
kept under continuous review after publication and are updated regularly to take account of changing 
technology. 
International Involvement 
Standards Australia is responsible for ensuring that the Australian viewpoint is considered in the 
formulation of international Standards and that the latest international experience is incorporated in 
national Standards. This role is vital in assisting local industry to compete in international markets. 
Standards Australia represents Australia at both ISO (The International Organization 
for Standardization) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). 
Electronic Standards 
All Australian Standards are available in electronic editions, either downloaded individually from our 
web site, or via On-Line and DVD subscription services. For more information phone 1300 65 46 46 or
